# iot-innotivation-workshop
Teaching Python &amp; Innovation through a MicroPython based Internet-of-things workshop

## Hardware
We use ESP32 microcontrollers, and various sensors and
actuators. Primary components are:

 - Sparkfun ESP32 Thing
 - 1m/30 WS2812B LEDStrip (also called NeoPixels)
 - Elecfreak Tinker:kit (intended for micro:bit)
 - DHT22 humidity sensor
 - Jumper cables, and sometimes breakout boards

## Libraries
To ease the burden on the students, we have made a small MicroPython
library to make it easier to interface with the various sensors and
actuators. The library is available at
https://github.com/Datanauterne/micropython-tinkerlib

The library includes example for each of the different sensors and actuators.
